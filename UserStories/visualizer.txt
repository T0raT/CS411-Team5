As a music enthusiasts, I love listening to my playlist, but sometimes it would be 
nice to visualize it. 

For example, Spotify Wrapped sometimes gives you “auras,” or what “type of listener” 
you are. By spotify's definiton, it generates this aura image based on the "energy" 
from your favorite music albums.

The Head to Head wep app will check my monthly or weekly listening history and find my 
top songs and artists.

This way, Head to Head will be able to ultilize an image generator to generate an 
personalized album cover of my listening history. (The more im typing this the more I 
feel like im describing NFTs LMFAO)

Visualization of my favorite music allows me to easily share a personalized image with 
my friends.

I can also easily engage with other music enthuists with a truly unique "album cover" 
that represents my passion for music.
