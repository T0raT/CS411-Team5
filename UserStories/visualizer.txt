As a music fan, I love listening to my playlist, but sometimes it would be nice to visualize it. 

For example, Spotify Wrapped sometimes gives you “auras,” or what “type of listener” you are. 

I want to be able to see a picture or some type of generated image that combines all the different types of music I listen to into one singular symbol.
