As a avid music enthusiast

I want to be able to register an account without extra steps.

Since I already have an spotify account, just using my pre-existing spotify account would do.

This way, the website can have direct access to my listening history while being user 
friendly.

Knowing that I can just jump right in with a streamlined process provides an 
effortless and enjoyable experience as an new user.
