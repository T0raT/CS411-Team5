I am a gamer who often likes to compete with my friends (both real life ones and virtual ones over the internet). 

In these video games, I am able to see a Leader Board that tells me who has the most points in winning games. 

I want to be able to do the same while listening to music; make friends (virtual ones too) and compare stats over a leadership board. I find myself eager to be a “winner.”
