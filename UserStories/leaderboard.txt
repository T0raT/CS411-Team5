I am a gamer who often likes to compete with my friends (both real life ones and 
virtual ones over the internet), but I am also a music enthusiasit who loves sharing 
my listening history with my friends.

In these video games, I am able to see a Leader Board that tells me who has the most 
points in winning games. 

I want to be able to do the same while listening to music; make friends (virtual ones 
too) and compare stats over a leadership board. I find myself eager to be a “winner.”

The leaderboard is also a good way to find other users who share my passion for music 
and maybe even share with each other our favorite artists.
