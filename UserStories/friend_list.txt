As a avid music listener, I would love to see the stats of my friends too.

Through the my spotify account, Head to Head can import my friends list directly from 
spotify.

Head to Head also allows me to search up my friends directly and add them through the 
web app too.

This way, I can easily share my statistics because friends will be able to see each 
other statistics.

In regards to privacy, I have the options to hide my statistics or choose what I want 
others to see.

I can also view those of my friends, gaining insight into their musical preferences 
and discovering new artists or genres that I may have overlooked.
