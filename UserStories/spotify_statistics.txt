I am an avid music listener who uses Spotify. 

I love comparing who is a bigger fan of Taylor Swift with my friends, but I get 
frustrated because I cannot do so until the end of the year: Spotify Wrapped. 

If I want to access stats that spotify wrapped provides, spotify doesn't have a 
function for that other than listening history.

Head to head presents my listening history in an organized way, but this isn't the 
only feature.

It can provide more insightful staistics such as my most streamed songs, my top 
artists, album and even genre.

And if I wanted to check my stats on a specific song, I just have to search up the 
song, select it and it will give me total plays on the specific song.
