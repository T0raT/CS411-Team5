I am an avid music listener who uses Spotify. 

I love comparing who is a bigger fan of Taylor Swift with my friends, but I get frustrated because I cannot do so until the end of the year: Spotify Wrapped. 

Even then, I am not sure if she will even make it on my top-10 list (as it only displays your top hits). 

I get annoyed because I am unable to see the listening statistics for other artists that I also love, but cannot access.
