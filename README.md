# CS411-Team5: Head-To-Head
<sup>bro how are you supposed to format this crap anyways?</sup> 

## What it do
Web application that allows you to compare your "Spotify Wrapped" (Spotify API) with your friends all year round (compare your stat's "head to head." (Youtube API/ OpenAI API - to get reviews from other users/ listeners)

<sub>Hopefully, we can get GPT to roast the fuck out of your choices.</sub>

## How do
Current tech stack choice:
* React.js
* Flask
* MongoDB

Planned API's:
* Spotify
* OpenAI GPT-3
* Youtube (Unsure)
* OpenAI DALLÂ·E (Could be interesting but could also be too insane)
